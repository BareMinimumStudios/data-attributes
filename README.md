# DataAttributes

### What is Data Attributes?
Data Attributes is a Minecraft mod, initially released for Minecraft 1.17.1 using the Fabric ecosystem. The mod does two things: overhauls Minecraft's entity attribute system to be more dynamic and to include follow on attributes (something found in many other games); and exposes entity attributes to a datapack system - allowing servers/pack makers to customise every aspect of the entity attribute system.


### F.A.Q.
As I develop and release more mods, it becomes challenging to provide support for them all, especially when the *vast* majority of comments are about how Forge is better than Fabric and I'm an idiot for not using it. Therefore, I have provided a question-answer block below.

 - Will you make a Forge version?
  - No, it will not be developed using Forge; however, the license allows you to do so yourself. 
 - I think that I've found a bug/crash, where can I report it?
  - Please make an entry to the Issue Tracker [here](https://github.com/CleverNucleus/DataAttributes/issues).
 - I have a feature suggestion/request, where can I ask about it?
  - Please make a pull request if you are a developer; or, if you cannot code, you may make a suggestion using the Issue Tracker linked above.
