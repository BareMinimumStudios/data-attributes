## Changes ⚙️
- Adjusting the mod to a beta release cycle, updates will be less frequent.
- It is getting to the point where it is functional enough to use without corruption.
- Fixed possible `NaN` calculation when smoothness was `0`. This is resolved by clamping the smoothness during calculation.
- The only thing that may be incorrect is the diminishing scale, which will be addressed. Otherwise, documentation and cleanup will begin, and this mod will release with **PlayerEX** come time.
