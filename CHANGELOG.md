## Notes 🍋
- Certain translation keys are not functional in this update.
- The mod is relatively stable, but due to the lack of a certain feature with items, it will be in the alpha channel for now.
- Take caution if you plan on using the mod (as usual with alpha builds).

## Changes 🌽
- Updated dependencies to `1.21` equivalent versions.
- Changed internal networking to abide by version.
- `ItemFields` have changed to fit `1.21` definitions.
- 💖 The API now takes in `RegistryEntry` along with the targeted attribute.
    - This also goes for **all events**.
    - `IEntityAttribute` has also been extended to get its `RegistryEntry`.
