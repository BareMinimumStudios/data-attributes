## Additions ðŸ’«
- Added the `DefaultAttributeFactory`, which can be used in mods to add extra defaults to the config.
  - Currently, it is limited to hard-code, 
- Added `EntityAttributeSupplier` to the mod again.
  - Its purpose is just to be a wrapper on lazily evaluated `EntityAttribute` values.
