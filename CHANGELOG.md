## Additions üçé
- We use Interface Injection for all API interfaces now. Rejoice.

## Changes üåΩ
- Dropped `WrapMethod` in favor of an `Inject` that just will perform nearly the same way. Connector folks rejoice. You can play PlayerEX with this latest build now (somehow).
- Edited some other mixins.
- 1.21 will take some time to catch up, for I wish to go over DataAttributes again (primarily the `DefaultAttributeFactory`, I have big plans for it!)
